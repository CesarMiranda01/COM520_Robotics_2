## ðŸŽ¯ Features

- **Real-time face detection** using webcam feed
- **Haar cascade classifier** for accurate face recognition
- **Red bounding boxes** around detected faces
- **Cross-platform compatibility** (Windows, Linux, Raspberry Pi)
- **Simple keyboard control** (press 'q' to quit)

## ðŸ“‹ Requirements

### Hardware
- Webcam (built-in or external)
- Computer with Python support

### Software Dependencies
```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install numpy
```
